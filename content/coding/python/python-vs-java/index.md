## Python vs. Java
A VS. notes between Python and Java.

### Type casting

- Python: **int(1.9)**, **float(1)**, **str(1.9)**    
- Java:  
    * Narrowing casting: (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
      **(int)1.9**, **(float)9.78**    
      double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte  
    * Widening casting: automatically - converting a smaller type to a larger type size  
      byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double  

### True or False

- Python: True/False  
- Java: true/false   

### Map sorting

- Python:  
Easy to use sorted() and lambda to sort dict/map by keys or values  
- Java:  
Use Collections.sort() and Comparator to sort map by keys or values
