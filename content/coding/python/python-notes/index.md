### Class or Static Variables in Python

In C++ and Java, we can use static keyword to make a variable as class variable. The variables which donâ€™t have preceding static keyword are instance variables.  

The Python approach is simple, it **doesnâ€™t** require a static keyword. All variables which are assigned a value in class declaration are class variables. And variables which are assigned values inside methods are instance variables.  

### True or False

**Most Values are True:** 
- Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.  
- Any string is True, except empty strings.  
- Any number is True, except 0.  
- Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.  

**Some Values are False:**  
In fact, there are not many values that evaluates to False,  
- except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "",  
- the number 0, and the value None.  
- And of course the value False evaluates to False.
