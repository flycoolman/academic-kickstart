## Install modules
    sudo modprobe bonding
    lsmod | grep bond
    sudo apt-get install ifenslave


## Temporary testing
To create a bond interface composed of the first two physical NCs in your system, issue the below command. However this method of creating bond interface is ephemeral and **DOES NOT** survive system reboot.  

    sudo ip link add bond0 type bond mode 802.3ad
    sudo ip link set eth0 master bond0
    sudo ip link set eth1 master bond0

## Permanant configuration
To create a permanent bond interface, use the method to manually edit interfaces configuration file. Details about the bond interface can be obtained by displaying the content of the below kernel file using cat command as shown.

    nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

    cat /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

### Access port
    root@R107-U04:/home/ba# cat /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # For more information, see netplan(5).

## Change Transmit Hash
If the Transmit Hash Policy is changed, to reboot the Ubuntu for the new policy taking effect.
